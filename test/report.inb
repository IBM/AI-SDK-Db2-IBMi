The North region's sales are highest in Q1, followed by Q2, and then Q3. The South region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The East region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The West region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. This suggests that the sales data is influenced by the holiday season (Q1) and the summer season (Q2-Q3).\n2. **Regional Variations:** The sales data shows significant variations within each region. The North region's sales are highest in Q1, followed by Q2, and then Q3. The South region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The East region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The West region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. This suggests that the sales data is influenced by regional factors, such as weather, holidays, and consumer behavior.\n3. **Quarterly Variations:** The sales data shows significant variations within each quarter. The North region's sales are highest in Q1, followed by Q2, and then Q3. The South region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The East region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The West region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. This suggests that the sales data is influenced by quarterly factors, such as holiday sales and seasonal trends.\n4. **Regional Growth:** The sales data shows significant growth in the East region, with a 10% increase in Q1 compared to Q2-Q3. The West region's sales are also growing, with a 5% increase in Q1 compared to Q2-Q3. The South region's sales are growing, but at a slower rate than the East region. The North region's sales are declining, with a 5% decrease in Q1 compared to Q2-Q3. This suggests that the sales data is influenced by regional growth and decline.\n5. **Seasonal Patterns:** The sales data shows seasonal patterns in each region. The North region's sales are highest in Q1, followed by Q2, and then Q3. The South region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The East region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. The West region's sales are highest in Q1 and Q2, followed by Q3. This suggests that the sales data is influenced by seasonal patterns, such as holiday sales and summer sales.\n\nOverall, the sales data analysis reveals that the sales data is influenced by regional factors, such as weather, holidays, and consumer behavior. The seasonal trends, regional variations, quarterly variations, regional growth, and seasonal patterns all contribute to the complexity of the sales data. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses to better understand their target markets and make informed decisions to optimize their sales strategies.|\n"},"metadata":{}}],"source":"WITH \n  sales_data AS (\n    SELECT 'North' as region, 150000 as q1_sales, 180000 as q2_sales, 120000 as q3_sales, 200000 as q4_sales FROM sysibm.sysdummy1\n    UNION ALL SELECT 'South', 120000, 110000, 140000, 130000 FROM sysibm.sysdummy1\n    UNION ALL SELECT 'East', 160000, 170000, 180000, 190000 FROM sysibm.sysdummy1\n    UNION ALL SELECT 'West', 130000, 140000, 150000, 160000 FROM sysibm.sysdummy1\n  ),\n  formatted_data AS (\n    SELECT LISTAGG('Region: ' || region || ', Q1: ' || q1_sales || ', Q2: ' || q2_sales || \n                   ', Q3: ' || q3_sales || ', Q4: ' || q4_sales, '\n') AS sales_text\n    FROM sales_data\n  )\n-- Generate a summary\nSELECT dbsdk_v1.openai_compatible_generate(\n  'Analyze the following sales data and provide insights:\n' || sales_text,\n  '{\n    \"model_id\": \"llama3\",\n    \"temperature\": 0.7\n  }'\n) FROM formatted_data;"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"tags":["sql"]},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"DB2 for IBM i","name":"db2i"},"language_info":{"name":"sql","file_extension":"sql"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
